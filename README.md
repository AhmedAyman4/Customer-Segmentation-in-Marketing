**Problem Definition**

**Objective:** To determine the impact of the acquisition channel on student learning outcomes and identify geographical regions where social media platforms are the primary source of platform discovery. 

**Research Questions:**

1. **Acquisition Channel Impact:** 
   * Does the acquisition channel significantly influence student performance, engagement, and retention rates? 
   * Are there specific acquisition channels that consistently lead to superior student outcomes? 

2. **Geographical Distribution of Social Media Discovery:**
   * In which geographical regions are students most likely to discover the platform through social media platforms like YouTube and Facebook?
   * Are there specific regions where a focused social media marketing strategy would be most effective?

**Data Analysis Tasks:**
 
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. 
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct a thorough analysis of the data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables. 
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features that capture the nuances of student behavior and acquisition channels. 
4. **Clustering:** Employ k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their characteristics and behaviors. 
5. **Result Interpretation:** Analyze the clusters to identify distinct customer segments and derive actionable insights to inform marketing strategies. 

By addressing these research questions, we aim to optimize our acquisition strategy, improve student outcomes, and allocate marketing resources effectively.
