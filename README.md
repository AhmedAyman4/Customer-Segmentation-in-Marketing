# Customer Segmentation in Marketing

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer acquisition channels and their impact on student learning outcomes for an educational platform. Using machine learning clustering techniques, we segment customers to optimize marketing strategies and improve resource allocation across different geographical regions and acquisition channels.

## Problem Definition

### **Objective**

To determine the impact of acquisition channels on student learning outcomes and identify geographical regions where social media platforms are the primary source of platform discovery.

### **Research Questions**

1. **Acquisition Channel Impact**

   - Does the acquisition channel significantly influence student performance, engagement, and retention rates?
   - Are there specific acquisition channels that consistently lead to superior student outcomes?

2. **Geographical Distribution of Social Media Discovery**
   - In which geographical regions are students most likely to discover the platform through social media platforms like YouTube and Facebook?
   - Are there specific regions where a focused social media marketing strategy would be most effective?

## Methodology

### **Data Analysis Pipeline**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct thorough analysis to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create relevant features that capture the nuances of student behavior and acquisition channels
4. **Clustering Analysis**: Employ k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their characteristics and behaviors
5. **Result Interpretation**: Analyze clusters to identify distinct customer segments and derive actionable insights

## Dataset Description

The analysis is based on customer data including:

- **CLV (Customer Lifetime Value)**: Total revenue generated by each customer
- **Minutes Watched**: Total video consumption time per customer
- **Channel**: Acquisition channel (Google, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Friends, Other)
- **Region**: Geographical classification (Anglo-Saxon, European, Rest of World)

#### **Correlation Matrix Insights**

The heatmap reveals important relationships between key variables:

- **Minutes Watched vs CLV**: Weak positive correlation (r ≈ 0.2), suggesting customers who watch more videos have slightly higher lifetime value
- **CLV vs Region**: Moderate negative correlation (r ≈ -0.4), indicating regional differences significantly influence customer lifetime value
- **Minutes Watched vs Channel**: Moderate negative correlation (r ≈ -0.3), suggesting acquisition channel affects viewing behavior patterns

### **Customer Segmentation Results**

Our clustering analysis identified **8 distinct customer segments** based on CLV and minutes watched:

| Segment                       | CLV Level | Video Consumption | Key Characteristics               |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Instagram Explorers**       | Low       | High              | High engagement, low monetization |
| **LinkedIn Networkers**       | High      | Moderate          | Professional users, high value    |
| **Anglo-Saxon Multi-Channel** | Diverse   | Diverse           | Varied behavior patterns          |
| **Friends' Influence**        | Moderate  | Moderate          | Word-of-mouth driven              |
| **Facebook Followers**        | High      | Moderate          | Social media converts well        |
| **European Multi-Channel**    | Diverse   | Diverse           | Regional preferences              |
| **Twitter Devotees**          | Low       | High              | High engagement, low conversion   |
| **Google-YouTube Mix**        | Moderate  | Moderate          | Search-driven discovery           |

## Strategic Insights & Recommendations

### **Key Insights**

1. **CLV Independence**: Customer lifetime value doesn't solely drive viewing behavior, indicating diverse user motivations
2. **Channel Effectiveness**: Social media channels show varying conversion rates - Facebook and LinkedIn outperform Instagram and Twitter for CLV
3. **Regional Variations**: Geographic location significantly impacts customer value, suggesting need for localized strategies
4. **Engagement Patterns**: High video consumption doesn't always correlate with high CLV

### **Marketing Recommendations**

#### **Channel-Specific Strategies**

- **Focus on LinkedIn and Facebook** for high-CLV customer acquisition
- **Reduce Twitter investment** - smallest segment with lowest ROI (58 observations, low CLV)
- **Develop retention strategies** for Instagram and Twitter users to improve their CLV
- **Leverage Google-YouTube synergy** for search-driven discovery

#### **Regional Strategies**

- **Anglo-Saxon Markets**: Continue strong performance with multi-channel approach
- **European Markets**: Increase investment - highest CLV potential but underperforming in volume
- **Rest of World**: Focus on LinkedIn and Facebook as primary channels

#### **Content & Engagement**

- **Facebook Users**: Capitalize on high engagement (2,700+ minutes average watch time)
- **Create segment-specific content** tailored to each group's viewing behavior
- **Implement retention programs** for high-engagement, low-CLV segments

## Technical Implementation

### **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Data analysis and machine learning
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Clustering algorithms (K-means, Hierarchical)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive analysis
